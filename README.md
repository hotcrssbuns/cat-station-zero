# Cat Station 0

Cat Station 0 is a janky text-based space station management game where you command a space station crewed entirely by cute kitty cats ^•ﻌ•^ As the station commander, you must manage crucial resources, handle emergencies, and ensure the survival and comfort of your feline friends.

This is also one of my first games, so it's quite shit. But hey, the cats are cute.

## How 2 Play

Cat Station 0 operates through a command interface where you can:
- Check station status and resource levels
- View and assign resources to tasks
- Complete tasks to avoid exploding
- Monitor your kitty crew's well-being

Each turn, your station's systems will degrade. You'll need to prioritize tasks based on their urgency and your available resources.
